I am a Cyber-Security Consultant & Ethical Hacker, specialized in Red Teaming, Penetration Testing, Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)

My other activities include Teaching & Coordinating in both private and academic Cyber-Security courses.

Last but not least, I do some Vulnerability Research & Malware Analysis in my spare time, and I'm the current leader of CeSeNA Security.
